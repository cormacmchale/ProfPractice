An ionic App

Ridesharing application.
The idea occurred when surfing the internet how to get from Dublin airport back to Galway in a night time. 
Originally, the idea was to create an application out of a website www.blablacar.ru but to make it more appealing and interactive
It was decided that Ionic framework would suit the best to bring the idea to life. It was designed to write cross-platfrom, hybrid applications which perfectly suited for purpose. 


Technologies used:
-Ionic 4
-Google API
-Firebase database
