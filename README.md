An ionic App

Ridesharing application.

Originally, the idea was to create an application out of a website www.blablacar.ru but to make it more appealing and interactive
It was decided that Ionic framework would suit the best to bring the idea to life. It was decided to write cross-platfrom, hybrid application and ionic perfectly suites for purpose. 

Technologies used:
<details>
<summary>Ionic 4</summary>
<p>
  Advantages:
  1. Cross-platform (write once, run anywhere).
  2. Easy to adopt (as soon as you know css, html, js it wont be a problem to learn the framework).
  3. Build on Angular JS (provides many functionalities, makes code more manageable).
  4. Ionic Cordova plugin allows access to phone's hardware (camera, GPS, etc) which increases the performance.
  5. Well-written documentation, although some tutorials using ionic 3 some changes need to be made.

<summary>Google Map API</summary>
<p> Probably the first map API that comes to mind. Easy to use and implement. A large number of map services such as geolocation, autocomplete, markers, polylines, autocorrect, etc are available, you concentarte on what you want to do but not how to do it. Documentation is of great help as well. Map API makes app more interactive and appealing, which was one of the main goals.</p>
