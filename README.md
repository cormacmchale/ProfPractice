<h3>Introduction</h3>
RideShare/GoingMyWay - a ridesharing application.
<p>Originally, the idea was to create an application out of a website www.blablacar.ru but to make it more visually appealing and interactive.
By this, we mean an app that would look nice and be user friendly at the same time.  </p>
<p>It was decided that Ionic framework would suit the best to bring the idea to life. It was decided to write a cross-platfrom, hybrid application and ionic perfectly suited for purpose. We tried to make it as close as possible to a CRUD (create-read-update-delete) application. One of the main goals while trying to use the latest modern technologies was to build a set of skills. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>
Application allows to offer a  journey in the add journey section and view all the journeys offered in the map section. Consequently, 2 or more users can cooperate and plan a journey together if they agree on source and target destination as well as date and time(and probably even finance). A user can also delete journeys if a journey is completed or cancelled in manage journeys section.

<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
<details>
<summary>Ionic 4</summary>
<p>
  Advantages:
 <p> 1. Cross-platform (write once, run anywhere).</p>
 <p> 2. Easy to adopt (as soon as you know css, html, js it wont be a problem to learn the framework).</p>
 <p> 3. Build on Angular JS (provides many functionalities, makes code more manageable).</p>
 <p> 4. Ionic Cordova plugin allows access to phone's hardware (camera, GPS, etc) which increases the performance.</p>
 <p> 5. Well-written documentation, although some tutorials are still using ionic 3 consequently it is important to make sure the tutorial is up-to-date and if not then some changes need to be made.</p>
 </p>

<details>
<summary>Google Map API</summary>
<p> Probably the first map API that comes to mind. Easy to use and implement. A large number of map services such as geolocation, autocomplete, markers, polylines, autocorrect, etc are available, you concentarte on what you want to do but not how to do it. Documentation is of great help as well. Map API makes app more interactive and appealing, which was one of the main goals.</p>

<details>
  
<summary>Firebase database</summary>
<p> 1. Stores data in json (Javascript Object Notation) format. Which means no barrier between data and objects. No more realtions and   reference keys.</p>
<p>2. Minimum set up</p>
<p>3. Real time updates</p>
<p>4. Authentication</p>
<p>5. Storage (files, images, videos)</p>
 </details>
